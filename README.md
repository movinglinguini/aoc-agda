# Advent of Code Day One in Agda

## How to Use
The compiled code is in the file titled `DayOne`. Simply run

```
  ./DayOne testfile.txt
```

## What Does This Do?
This is supposed to solve the first problem of this year's [Advent of Code ](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1). Given a file with two associated arrays of numbers, sort the arrays, and then find their manhattan distance.

We believe this will work for any length of data, but we dare not try this out on a file with more than 4 data points. Enjoy!
